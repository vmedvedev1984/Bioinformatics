Pygenome provide access to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome from Python. 
Genes, promoters, terminators, and intergenic, sequences as well as the deletion loci created by the genome wide deletion project are available by their systematic names (like YPR080w) or by standard name (like CYC1). 
DNA sequences are returned as Biopython SeqRecord objects.

Pydna is a python package that provides a human-readable formal descriptions of üß¨ cloning and genetic assembly strategies in Python üêç for simulation and verification. 
Pydna can be used as executable documentation for cloning.
Designing genetic constructs with many components and steps, like recombinant metabolic pathways üß´, often makes accurate documentation difficult, as seen in the poor state of scientific literature ‚ò¢Ô∏è
A cloning strategy expressed in pydna is complete, unambiguous and stable.
